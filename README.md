<p align="center">
  Proxy, in information technology and telecommunications, indicates a type of server that acts as an intermediary for requests from customers looking for resources on other servers, decoupling access to the web from the browser. A client connects to the proxy server, requesting some service (such as a file, web page or any other resource available on another server), and the latter evaluates and executes the request in order to simplify and manage its complexity. Proxies were invented to add structure and encapsulation to distributed systems.
